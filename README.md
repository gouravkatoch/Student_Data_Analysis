# 📊 Student Records Processing with PySpark

## 📝 Overview
This project generates synthetic student records and processes them using **PySpark** for data analysis. The dataset consists of randomly generated student names and marks, which are analyzed using PySpark functions to derive insights.

## ✨ Features
✅ Generates a CSV file with **10,000+ synthetic student records**  
✅ Loads the dataset into a **PySpark DataFrame** for processing  
✅ Performs **basic analysis** such as aggregations, filtering, and statistics  
✅ Demonstrates **PySpark's capabilities** for large-scale data handling  
✅ Showcases **data engineering best practices**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 **Python** - Scripting and data handling  
🔹 **Faker** - Generating synthetic student records  
🔹 **PySpark** - Data processing and analysis  

## 🚀 Installation
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install faker pyspark
```

## 🔧 Usage
1️⃣ Run the notebook to generate a dataset (`student_records.csv`).  
2️⃣ Use **PySpark** to load and analyze the data.  
3️⃣ Modify the analysis as needed to gain further insights!
